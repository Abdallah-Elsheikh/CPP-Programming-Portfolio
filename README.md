# C++ Programming Portfolio (CS Fundamentals)

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of C++ projects demonstrating core Computer Science concepts, including **Data Structures**, **Algorithms**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and **File Handling**.

## Project List

| File Name | Category | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`Student-Management-System.cpp`** | File Handling & OOP | A complete CRUD system to manage student records (Add, Update, Delete, Search) using `Vectors` and storing data in external text files. |
| **`Decision-Stack-LinkedList.cpp`** | Data Structures | Implementation of a **Stack** using a **Linked List** to track and manage a history of decisions (Last-In-First-Out). |
| **`Pi-MonteCarlo-Simulation.cpp`** | Algorithms & Math | An algorithmic simulation to estimate the value of **PI** using the **Monte Carlo** method and random sampling. |
| **`Loan-Payment-Calculator.cpp`** | Math & Functions | A financial tool that calculates monthly loan payments and total interest using mathematical formulas and function overloading. |
| **`Coin-Flip-Probability.cpp`** | Simulation | A program that simulates coin flips to demonstrate probability concepts and random number generation in C++. |
